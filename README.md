# Project Overview
In this project, we'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Our goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from ___loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks.___ At the end of the notebook, we'll be able to visualize the results of our trained Generator to see how it performs; our generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
## Dataset
We'll be using the  [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train our adversarial networks.
This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) so we should define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested to utilize a GPU for training.
